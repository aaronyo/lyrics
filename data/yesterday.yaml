title: Yesterday
artist: The Beatles
lyrics: |
  Yesterday,
  All my troubles seemed so far away,
  Now it looks as though they're here to stay,
  Oh, I believe in yesterday.
  
  Suddenly,
  I'm not half the man I used to be,
  There's a shadow hanging over me,
  Oh, yesterday came suddenly.
  
  Why she
  Had to go I don't know, she wouldn't say.
  I said,
  Something wrong, now I long for yesterday.
  
  Yesterday,
  Love was such an easy game to play,
  Now I need a place to hide away,
  Oh, I believe in yesterday.
  
  Why she
  Had to go I don't know, she wouldn't say.
  I said,
  Something wrong, now I long for yesterday.
  
  Yesterday,
  Love was such an easy game to play,
  Now I need a place to hide away,
  Oh, I believe in yesterday.
  
  Mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm.
