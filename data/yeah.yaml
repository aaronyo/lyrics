  Peace up!
  A Town Down!
  
  Yeah, okay! Lil Jon!
  
  Yeah, Yeah Yeah, Yeah yeah, Yeaah
  Yeah, Yeah yeah, Yeah yeah, Yeaah
  
  I'm in the club with my homies
  Tryna get a lil V-I
  Keep it down on the low key
  Cause you know how it feels
  I said shorty she was checkin up on me
  From the game she was spittin my ear
  You'd think that she knew me
  So we decided to chill
  
  Conversation got heavy
  She had me feelin like she's ready to blow!
  (Watch out! Watch out!)
  She was saying come get me, come get me
  So I got up and followed her to the floor
  She said baby let's go
  When I told her I said
  
  Yeah (yeah) Shorty got down and said come and get me
  Yeah (yeah) I got so caught up I forgot she told me
  Yeah (yeah) Her and my girl used to be the best of homies
  Yeah (yeah) Next thing I knew she was all up on me screaming
  Yeah, Yeah yeah, Yeah yeah, Yeaah
  Yeah, Yeah yeah, Yeah yeah, Yeaah
  
  She's all up in my head now
  Got me thinking that it might
  Be a good idea to take her with
  Me, cause she's ready to leave
  (let's go!)
  But I gotta keep it real now
  Cause on a one-to-ten
  She's a certified twenty
  but that just ain't me
  
  What I don't know is if I take that chance
  Just where's it gonna lead
  But what I do know is the way she dance
  Makes shorty all right for me
  The way she get low!
  I'm like yeah, just work that out for me
  She asked for one more dance and
  I'm like yeah
  How the hell am I supposed to leave?
  And I said
  
  
  Luda!
  
  Watch out! My outfit's ridiculous
  In the club lookin so conspicuous
  And Rowl! These women all on the prowl
  If you hold the head steady, I'ma milk the cow
  Forget about the game, I'ma spit the truth
  I won't stop till I get em in they birthday suits
  So gimme the rhythm and it'll be off with they clothes
  Then bend over to the front and touch your toes!
  I left the jag and I took the rolls
  If they ain't cutting then I put em on foot patrol
  How you like me now
  When my pinky's valued over three hundred thousand
  Let's drink, you the one to please
  Ludacris feel cups like double D's
  Me and Ursh once more and we leave em dead
  We want a lady in the street but a freak in the bed to say
  
  
  Take that and rewind it back
  Lil Jon got the beat to make ya booty go (clap)
  Take that and rewind it back
  Ursher got the voice to make ya booty go (clap)
  Take that and rewind it back
  Ludacris got the flow to make ya booty go (clap)
  Take that and rewind it back
  Lil Jon got the beat to make ya booty go (clap)
