{artist: Percy Faith, lyrics: "\r\nThere's a summer place\nWhere it may rain or storm\n\
    Yet I'm safe and warm\nFor within that summer place\nYour arms reach out to me\n\
    And my heart is free from all care\nFor it knows\n\nThere are no gloomy skies\n\
    When seen through the eyes\nOf those who are blessed with love\n\nAnd the sweet\
    \ secret of\nA summer place\nIs that it's anywhere\nWhen two people share\nAll\
    \ their hopes\nAll their dreams\nAll their love\n\nThere's a summer place\nWhere\
    \ it may rain or storm\nYet I'm safe and warm\nIn your arms, in your arms\nIn\
    \ your arms, in your arms\nIn your arms, in your arms", lyrics-url: 'http://www.lyricstime.com/percy-faith-a-summer-place-lyrics.html',
