{artist: Marvin Gaye, lyrics: "\r\n(Norman Whitfield/Barrett Strong)\nOoh, I bet you're\
    \ wondering how I knew\n'bout you're plans to make me blue\nwith some other guy\
    \ that you knew before.\nBetween the two of us guys\nyou know I love you more.\n\
    It took me by surprise I must say,\nwhen I found out yesterday.\nDon't you know\
    \ that...\n\n[Chorus:]\nI heard it through the grapevine\nnot much longer would\
    \ you be mine.\nOh I heard it through the grapevine,\nOh and I'm just about to\
    \ lose my mind.\nHoney, honey yeah.\n\nI know that a man ain't supposed to cry,\n\
    but these tears I can't hold inside.\nLosin' you would end my life you see,\n\
    cause you mean that much to me.\nYou could have told me yourself\nthat you love\
    \ someone else.\nInstead...\n\n[Chorus]\n\nPeople say believe half of what you\
    \ see,\nson, and none of what you hear.\nI can't help bein' confused\nif it's\
    \ true please tell me dear?\nDo you plan to let me go\nfor the other guy you loved\
    \ before?\nDon't you know...\n\n[Chorus]", title: I Heard It Through The Grapevine,
