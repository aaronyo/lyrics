{artist: 'Monkees, The', lyrics: "\r\n(Neil Diamond)\nI thought love was only true\
    \ in fairy tales\nMeant for someone else but not for me.\nLove was out to get\
    \ me\nThat's the way it seemed.\nDisappointment haunted all my dreams.\n\nThen\
    \ I saw her face, now I'm a believer\nNot a trace of doubt in my mind.\nI'm in\
    \ love, I'm a believer!\nI couldn't leave her if I tried.\n\nI thought love was\
    \ more or less a given thing,\nSeems the more I gave the less I got.\nWhat's the\
    \ use in tryin'?\nAll you get is pain.\nWhen I needed sunshine I got rain.\n\n\
    Then I saw her face, now I'm a believer\nNot a trace of doubt in my mind.\nI'm\
    \ in love, I'm a believer!\nI couldn't leave her if I tried.", title: I'm A Believer,
