{artist: Elvis Presley, lyrics: "\r\nAre you lonesome tonight,\ndo you miss me tonight?\n\
    Are you sorry we drifted apart?\nDoes your memory stray to a brighter sunny day\n\
    When I kissed you and called you sweetheart?\nDo the chairs in your parlor seem\
    \ empty and bare?\nDo you gaze at your doorstep and picture me there?\nIs your\
    \ heart filled with pain, shall I come back again?\nTell me dear, are you lonesome\
    \ tonight?\n\nI wonder if you're lonesome tonight\nYou know someone said that\
    \ the world's a stage\nAnd each must play a part.\nFate had me playing in love\
    \ you as my sweet heart.\nAct one was when we met, I loved you at first glance\n\
    You read your line so cleverly and never missed a cue\nThen came act two, you\
    \ seemed to change and you acted strange\nAnd why I'll never know.\nHoney, you\
    \ lied when you said you loved me\nAnd I had no cause to doubt you.\nBut I'd rather\
    \ go on hearing your lies\nThan go on living without you.\nNow the stage is bare\
    \ and I'm standing there\nWith emptiness all around\nAnd if you won't come back\
    \ to me\nThen make them bring the curtain down.\n\nIs your heart filled with pain,\
    \ shall I come back again?\nTell me dear, are you lonesome tonight?", title: 'Are
    You Lonesome Tonight?', url: 'http://www.lyricstime.com/elvis-presley-are-you-lonesome-tonight-lyrics.html'}
