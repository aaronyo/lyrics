{artist: '5th Dimension, The', lyrics: "\r\n(Words by James Rado and Gerome Ragni:\
    \ Music by Galt MacDermot)\nWhen the moon is in the Seventh House\nAnd Jupiter\
    \ aligns with Mars\nThen peace will guide the planets\nAnd love will steer the\
    \ stars\nThis is the dawning of the age of Aquarius\nAge of Aquarius\nAquarius!\n\
    Aquarius!\n\nHarmony and understanding\nSympathy and trust abounding\nNo more\
    \ falsehoods or derisions\nGolden living dreams of visions\nMystic crystal revelation\n\
    And the mind's true liberation\nAquarius!\nAquarius!\n\nWhen the moon is in the\
    \ Seventh House\nAnd Jupiter aligns with Mars\nThen peace will guide the planets\n\
    And love will steer the stars\nThis is the dawning of the age of Aquarius\nAge\
    \ of Aquarius\nAquarius!\nAquarius!\nAquarius!\nAquarius!\n\n[Instrumental and\
    \ tempo shift]\n\nLet the sunshine, let the sunshine in, the sunshine in\nLet\
    \ the sunshine, let the sunshine in, the sunshine in\nLet the sunshine, let the\
    \ sunshine in, the sunshine in\n\n[Continue to end with concurrent scat]\n\nOh,\
    \ let it shine, c'mon\nNow everybody just sing along\nLet the sun shine in\nOpen\
    \ up your heart and let it shine on in\nWhen you are lonely, let it shine on\n\
    Got to open up your heart and let it shine on in\nAnd when you feel like you've\
    \ been mistreated\nAnd your friends turn away\nJust open your heart, and shine\
    \ it on in\n\n[Fade]", lyrics-url: 'http://www.lyricstime.com/fifth-dimension-the-aquarius-let-the-sun-shine-in-lyrics.html',
