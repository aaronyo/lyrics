{artist: Bobby Lewis, lyrics: "\r\n(Ritchie Adams and Malou Rene)\nI couldn't sleep\
    \ at all last night\nGot to thinkin' of you\nBaby things weren't right\nWell I\
    \ was tossin' and turnin'\nTurnin' and tossin'\na-tossin' and turnin' all night\n\
    \nI kicked the blankets on the floor\nTurned my pillow upside down\nI never never\
    \ did before\n'cause I was tossin' and turnin'\nTurnin' and tossin'\na-tossin'\
    \ and turnin' all night\n\nJumped out of bed\nTurned on the light\nI pulled down\
    \ the shade\nWent to the kitchen for a bite\nRolled up the shade\nTurned off the\
    \ light\nI jumped back into bed\nIt was the middle of the night\n\nThe clock downstairs\
    \ was strikin' four\nCouldn't get you off my mind\nI heard the milkman at the\
    \ door\n'cause I was tossin' and turnin'\nTurnin' and tossin'\na-tossin' and turnin'\
    \ all night\n\nJumped out of bed\nTurned on the light\nI pulled down the shade\n\
    Went to the kitchen for a bite\nRolled up the shade\nTurned off the light\nI jumped\
    \ back into bed\nIt was the middle of the night\n\nThe clock downstairs was strikin'\
    \ four\nCouldn't get you off my mind\nI heard the milkman at the door\n'cause\
    \ I was tossin' and turnin'\nTurnin' and tossin'\na-tossin' and turnin' all, yay,\
    \ yay, yay\nI was a-tossin' and turnin'\n\n[Fade]\n\nTurnin' and tossin'", title: Tossin'
