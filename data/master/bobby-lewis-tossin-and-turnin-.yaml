  (Ritchie Adams and Malou Rene)
  I couldn't sleep at all last night
  Got to thinkin' of you
  Baby things weren't right
  Well I was tossin' and turnin'
  Turnin' and tossin'
  a-tossin' and turnin' all night
  
  I kicked the blankets on the floor
  Turned my pillow upside down
  I never never did before
  'cause I was tossin' and turnin'
  Turnin' and tossin'
  a-tossin' and turnin' all night
  
  Jumped out of bed
  Turned on the light
  I pulled down the shade
  Went to the kitchen for a bite
  Rolled up the shade
  Turned off the light
  I jumped back into bed
  It was the middle of the night
  
  The clock downstairs was strikin' four
  Couldn't get you off my mind
  I heard the milkman at the door
  'cause I was tossin' and turnin'
  Turnin' and tossin'
  a-tossin' and turnin' all night
  
  Jumped out of bed
  Turned on the light
  I pulled down the shade
  Went to the kitchen for a bite
  Rolled up the shade
  Turned off the light
  I jumped back into bed
  It was the middle of the night
  
  The clock downstairs was strikin' four
  Couldn't get you off my mind
  I heard the milkman at the door
  'cause I was tossin' and turnin'
  Turnin' and tossin'
  a-tossin' and turnin' all, yay, yay, yay
  I was a-tossin' and turnin'
  
  [Fade]
  
  Turnin' and tossin'
