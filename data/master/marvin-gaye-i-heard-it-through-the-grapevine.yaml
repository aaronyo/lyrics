title: I Heard It Through The Grapevine
lyrics: |
  (Norman Whitfield/Barrett Strong)
  Ooh, I bet you're wondering how I knew
  'bout you're plans to make me blue
  with some other guy that you knew before.
  Between the two of us guys
  you know I love you more.
  It took me by surprise I must say,
  when I found out yesterday.
  Don't you know that...
  
  [Chorus:]
  I heard it through the grapevine
  not much longer would you be mine.
  Oh I heard it through the grapevine,
  Oh and I'm just about to lose my mind.
  Honey, honey yeah.
  
  I know that a man ain't supposed to cry,
  but these tears I can't hold inside.
  Losin' you would end my life you see,
  cause you mean that much to me.
  You could have told me yourself
  that you love someone else.
  Instead...
  
  [Chorus]
  
  People say believe half of what you see,
  son, and none of what you hear.
  I can't help bein' confused
  if it's true please tell me dear?
  Do you plan to let me go
  for the other guy you loved before?
  Don't you know...
  
  [Chorus]
