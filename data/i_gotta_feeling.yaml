  I gotta feeling
  That tonight's gonna be a good night
  That tonight's gonna be a good night
  That tonight's gonna be a good good night
  
  A feeling
  That tonight's gonna be a good night
  That tonight's gonna be a good night
  That tonight's gonna be a good good night
  
  A feeling (Woo-hoo)
  That tonight's gonna be a good night
  That tonight's gonna be a good night
  That tonight's gonna be a good good night
  
  A feeling (Woo-hoo)
  That tonight's gonna be a good night
  That tonight's gonna be a good night
  That tonight's gonna be a good good night
  
  I feel
  
  Tonight's the night night
  Let's live it up
  I got my money
  Let's spend it UP
  Go out and smash it
  Like "Oh my God"
  Jump off that sofa
  Let's KICK IT off
  
  I know that we'll have a ball
  If we get down
  And go out
  And just lose it all
  
  I feel
  Stressed and I wanna let it go
  Lets go way out spaced out
  And losing all control
  
  Fill up my cup
  Mazel tov
  Look at her dancing
  Just take it off
  
  Let's paint the town
  We'll shut it down
  Let's burn the roof
  And then we'll do it again
  
  Let's do it, let's do it, let's do it, let's do it.
  And do it, and do it.
  Let's LIVE IT UP...
  Do it, and do it, and do it, do it, do it
  Let's do it, let's do it, let's do it.
  
  Cause I gotta feeling (Woo-hoo)
  That tonight's gonna be a good night
  That tonight's gonna be a good night
  That tonight's gonna be a good good night
  
  A feeling (Woo-hoo)
  That tonight's gonna be a good night
  That tonight's gonna be a good night
  That tonight's gonna be a good good night
  
  I feel
  
  Tonight's the night (Hey!)
  Let's live it up (Let's live it up!)
  I got my money (My pay)
  Let's spend it all (Let's spend it all!)
  
  Go out and smash it (Smash it!)
  Like "oh my God" (Like "Oh my God"!)
  Jump off that sofa (Come on!)
  Let's KICK IT off (Pump it!)
  
  Fill up my cup (Drink)
  Mazel tov (La' chaim)
  Look at her dancing (Move it, move it)
  Just take it off (Pump it!)
  
  Let's paint the town (Paint the town!)
  We'll shut it down (Shut it down!)
  Let's burn the roof
  And then we'll do it again
  
  Let's do it, let's do it, let's do it, let's do it.
  And do it, and do it.
  Let's LIVE IT UP...
  Do it, and do it, and do it, do it, do it
  Let's do it, let's do it, let's do it, do it, do it, do it.
  
  Here we come
  Here we go
  We gotta rock (Rock, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock)
  
  Easy come
  Easy go
  Now we on top (Top, top, top, top, top, top)
  
  Feel the shot
  Body rock
  Rock it don't stop (Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop)
  
  Round and round
  Up and down
  Around the clock (Clock, clock, clock, clock, clock, clock)
  
  Monday, Tuesday,
  Wednesday and Thursday
  Friday, Saturday
  Saturday AND Sunday
  
  Get, get, get, get, get, get with us
  You know what we say, say
  Party every day
  Pa-pa-pa-party every day
  
  And I'm feeling (Woo-hoo)
  That tonight's gonna be a good night
  That tonight's gonna be a good night
  That tonight's gonna be a good good night
  
  A feeling (Woo-hoo)
  That tonight's gonna be a good night
  That tonight's gonna be a good night
  That tonight's gonna be a good good night
  
  Woo-hoo
