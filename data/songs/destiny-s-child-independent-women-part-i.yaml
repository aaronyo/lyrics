  Question: Tell me what you think about me
  I buy my own diamonds and I buy my own rings
  Only ring your cell-y when I'm feelin lonely
  When it's all over please get up and leave
  Question: Tell me how you feel about this
  gotta control me boy you get dismissed
  Pay my own finalls, oh and I pay my own bills
  Always 50/50 in relationships
  
  The shoes on my feet
  I bought it
  The clothes I'm wearing
  I bought it
  The rock I'm rockin'
  I bought it
  'Cause I depend on me
  If I want it
  The watch I'm wearin'
  I bought it
  The house I live in
  I bought it
  The car I'm driving
  I bought it
  cause I depend on me
  (I depend on me)
  
  All the women who are independent
  Throw your hands up at me
  All the honeys who makin' money
  Throw your hands up at me
  All the mommas who profit dollas
  Throw your hands up at me
  All the ladies who truly feel me
  Throw your hands up at me
  
  Girl I didn't know you could get down like that
  Charlie, how your Angels get down like that
  Girl I didn't know you could get down like that
  Charlie, how your Angels get down like that
  
  Tell me how you feel about this
  Do what I want, live how I wanna live
  I worked hard and sacrificed to get what I get
  Ladies, it ain't easy bein' independent
  Question: How'd you like this knowledge that I brought
  Braggin' on that cash that he gave you is the front
  If you're gonna brag make sure it's your money you flaunt
  Depend on no one else to give you what you want
  
  The shoes on my feet
  I brought it
  The clothes I'm wearing
  I brought it
  The rock I'm rockin'
  I brought it
  'Cause I depend on me
  If I want it
  The watch I'm wearin'
  Ive got it
  The house I live in
  I bought it
  The car I'm driving
  I bought it
  I depend on me
  (I depend on me)
  
  All the women who are independent
  Throw your hands up at me
  All the honeys who makin' money
  Throw your hands up at me
  All the mommas who profit dollas
  Throw your hands up at me
  All the ladies who truly feel me
  Throw your hands up at me
  
  Girl I didn't know you could get down like that
  Charlie, how your Angels get down like that
  Girl I didn't know you could get down like that
  Charlie, how your Angels get down like Destiny's Child
  
  Wassup?
  You in the house?
  Sure 'nuff
  We'll break these people off Angel style
  
  Child of Destiny
  Independent beauty
  No one else can scare me
  Charlie's Angels
  
  Woah
  All the women who are independent
  Throw your hands up at me
  All the honeys who makin' money
  Throw your hands up at me
  All the mommas who profit dollas
  Throw your hands up at me
  All the ladies who truly feel me
  Throw your hands up at me
  
  Girl I didn't know you could get down like that
  Charlie, how your Angels get down like that
  (repeat until fade)
