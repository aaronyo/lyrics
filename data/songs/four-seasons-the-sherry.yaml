  Sher-er-rry, Sherry baby 
  
  Sher-er-rry, Sherry baby 
  
  
  
  She-e-e-e-e-e-e-ry ba-a-by (Sherry baby) 
  
  She-er-rry, can you come out tonight (Come come, come out toni-i-ight) 
  
  She-e-e-e-e-e-e-ry ba-a-by (Sherry baby) 
  
  She-er-rry, can you come out tonight 
  
  
  
  (Why don't you come out) (come out) to my twist party 
  
  (Come out) Where the bright moon shines 
  
  (Come out) We'll dance the night away 
  
  I'm gonna make-a you mi-yi-yi-ine 
  
  
  
  She-e-e-e-e-e-e-ry ba-a-by (Sherry baby) 
  
  She-er-rry, can you come out tonight 
  
  (Come come, come out toni-i-ight) 
  
  (Come come, come out toni-i-ight) 
  
  You-oo-ooh better ask your ma-a-ma (Sherry baby) 
  
  Te-ell her everything is all right 
  
  
  
  (Why don't you come out) (come out) with your red dress on 
  
  (Come out) Mmm, you look so fine 
  
  (Come out) Move it nice and easy 
  
  Girl, you'll make me lose my mi-ind 
  
  
  
  She-e-e-e-e-e-e-ry ba-a-by (Sherry baby) 
  
  She-er-rry, can you come out tonight 
  
  (Come come, come out toni-i-ight) 
  
  (Come come, come out toni-i-ight) 
  
  Sherry, Sherry baby 
  
  
  
  FADE 
  
  Sherry, Sherry baby
