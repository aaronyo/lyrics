peak-year: 2002
lyrics: |
  Look, if you had one shot, one opportunity
  To seize everything you ever wanted
  One moment
  Would you capture it or just let it slip?
  
  His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy
  There's vomit on his sweater already, mom's spaghetti
  He's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready
  To drop bombs, but he keeps on forgetting
  What he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud
  He opens his mouth, but the words won't come out
  He's chokin, how everybody's jokin now
  The clocks run out, times up over, bloah!
  Snap back to reality, Oh there goes gravity
  Oh, there goes Rabbit, he choked
  Hes so mad, but he wont give up that
  Is he knows
  He wont have it , he knows his whole back citys ropes
  It dont matter, hes dope
  He knows that, but he's broke
  Hes so stacked that he knows
  When he goes back to his mobile home, thats when its
  Back to the lab again yo
  This whole rap shit
  He better go capture this moment and hope it dont pass him
  
  [HOOK:]
  You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
  You own it, you better never let it go
  You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
  This opportunity comes once in a lifetime yo
  
  The souls escaping, through this hole that its gaping
  This world is mine for the taking
  Make me king, as we move toward a, new world order
  A normal life is borin, but superstardoms close to post mortam
  It only grows harder, only grows hotter
  He blows us all over these hoes is all on him
  Coast to coast shows, hes know as the globetrotter
  Lonely roads, God only knows
  Hes grown farther from home, hes no father
  He goes home and barely knows his own daughter
  But hold your nose cuz here goes the cold water
  These hoes dont want him no mo, hes cold product
  They moved on to the next schmoe who flows
  He nose dove and sold nada
  So the soap opera is told and unfolds
  I suppose its old potna, but the beat goes on
  Da da dum da dum da da
  
  [HOOK]
  
  No more games, Ima change what you call rage
  Tear this motherfuckin roof off like 2 dogs caged
  I was playin in the beginnin, the mood all changed
  I been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage
  But I kept rhymin and stepwritin the next cypher
  Best believe somebodys payin the pied piper
  All the pain inside amplified by the fact
  That I cant get by with my 9 to 5
  And I cant provide the right type of life for my family
  Cuz man, these goddam food stamps dont buy diapers
  And its no movie, theres no Mekhi Phifer, this is my life
  And these times are so hard and it's getting even harder
  Tryin to feed and water my seed, plus
  See dishonor caught up between bein a father and a prima donna
  Baby mama drama screamin on and
  Too much for me to wanna
  Stay in one spot, another jam or not
  Has gotten me to the point, I'm like a snail
  I've got to formulate a plot fore I end up in jail or shot
  Success is my only motherfuckin option, failures not
  Mom, I love you, but this trail has got to go
  I cannot grow old in Salems lot
  So here I go is my shot.
  Feet fail me not cuz maybe the only opportunity that I got
  
  [HOOK]
  
  You can do anything you set your mind to, man
