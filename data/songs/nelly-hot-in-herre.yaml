  I was like, good gracious - ass is bodacious (uhh)
  Flirtacious, tryin to show patience
  I'm waitin for the right time to shoot my steez (you know)
  Waitin for the right time to flash them ki's, then uhh
  I'm leavin, please believin - ohhh!
  Me and the rest of my heathens
  Check it, got it locked at the top of the Fo' Seasons
  Penthouse, roof top, birds I feedin
  No deceivin, nuttin up my sleeve and
  no teasin.. I need you to
  Get up up on the dance floor
  Give that man what he askin for
  Cause I feel like bustin loose
  and I feel like touchin you, uh uh
  And can't nobody stop the juice
  So baby tell me what's the use? I said
  
  [Chorus]
  It's gettin hot in herre (so hot), so take off all your clothes
  I am gettin so hot, I will take my clothes off
  It's gettin hot in here (so hot), so take off all your clothes
  I am - gettin so hot, I wanna take my clothes off
  
  Uh, uh, uh - let it hang alll out!

  Why you at the bar if you ain't poppin the bottles? (c'mon)
  What good is all the fame if you ain't fuckin the models
  I see you drivin, sports cars, ain't hittin the throttle
  And I'll be down to do a hundred, top down and goggles
  Got off the freeway, exit 106 and "Park"ed it
  Ash tray, flip gate, time to spark it
  Gucci collar for dollar, got out and walked it
  I spit game cause baby I can't talk it
  Warm, sweatin, it's hot up in this joint
  Vokal, tanktop, on at this point
  You with a winner so baby you can't loose
  I got secrets can't leave Cancun
  So take it off like your home alone
  You know dance in front your mirror while you're on the phone
  Checkin your reflection and tellin your best friend
  like "Girl I think my butt gettin big!"
  
  [Chorus]
  
  (Let it hang all out)
  Mix a little bit of ah, ah
  With a little bit of ah, ah
  (Let it just fall out)
  Give a little bit of ah, ah
  With a little bit of ah, ah
  (Let it hang all out)
  With a little bit of ah, ah
  And a sprinkle of that ah, ah
  (Let it just fall out)
  I like it when ya ah, ah
  Girl, baby make it ah, ah
  
  [Nelly]
  Stop pacin, time wastin
  I gotta a friend with a pole in the basement (what?)
  I'm just kiddin like Jason (oh)
  Unless you gon' do it
  Extra, extra - eh, spread the news (check it)
  Nelly took a trip from the Lou' to the Neptunes
  Came back with somethin thicker than fittin in Sasoons
  Say she got a thing about cuttin in restrooms - ohhhhh!
  
  [Chorus] - repeat 2X
  
  (Let it hang all out)
  Mix a little bit of ah, ah
  With a little bit of ah, ah
  (Let it just fall out)
  Give a little bit of ah, ah
  With a little bit of ah, ah
  (Let it hang all out)
  With a little bit of ah, ah
  And a sprinkle of that ah, ah
  (Let it just fall out)
  I like it when ya ah, ah
  Girl, baby make it ah, ah... ohhh!
