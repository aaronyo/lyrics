lyrics: |
  You know them old sugar daddies
  They be tricking they tell them girls
  I said you can have whatever you like
  I said you can have whatever you like
  Yeah
  
  [Chorus:]
  Stacks on deck. Patron on ice.
  We can pop bottles all night
  Baby you can have whatever you like
  I said you can have whatever you like.
  Yeah
  Late night sex, so wet and so tight
  I'll gas up the jet for you tonight and baby you can go wherever you like
  I said you can go wherever you like
  Yeah
  
  Anytime you want to pick up the telephone you
  know that it ain't nothing to drop a couple stacks on you
  If you want it you can get it my dear
  5 millions dollars homes drop the business I swear.
  Yeah
  
  I want your body. I need your body.
  As long as you got me you won't need nobody
  You want it, I got it. Go get it, I'll buy it
  Tell them other broke niggas be quiet
  
  [Chorus]
  
  Shawty you the hottest. Love the way you drop it.
  Brain so good could've sworn you went to college.
  100k deposit. Vacations in the tropics
  And everybody know it ain't tricking if you got it
  You ain't never ever gotta go in your wallet.
  Long as I got rubberband banks in my pocket.
  5 6 rides wit rims and a body kit.
  You ain't gotta downgrade you can get what I get
  My chick can have what she want.
  And go in any store for any bag she wants.
  She ain't never had a man like that.
  To buy you anything your heart desire like that.
  
  I want your body, I need your body.
  Long as you got me, you won't need nobody.
  You want it, I got it. Go get it, I'll buy it.
  Tell them other broke niggas be quiet.
  
  [Chorus]
  
  Talk big boy rides & big boy ice
  Let me put this big boy in your life.
  That thing get so wet & get so right
  Let me put this big boy in your life. that's right.
  
  I want your body, I need your body.
  Long as you got me, you won't need nobody.
  You want it, I got it. Go get it, I'll buy it.
  Tell them other broke niggas be quiet.
  
  [Chorus]
