lyrics: |
  Big girls dont cry, big girls don't cry
  
  Big girls don't cry (they don't cry)
  Big girls don't cry (who said they don't cry)
  My girl said good-bye (my oh my)
  My girl didn't cry (I wonder why)
  
  (Silly boy) Told my girl we had to break up
  (Silly boy) Thought that she would call my bluff
  (Silly boy) But she said to my surprise
  Big girls don't cry
  
  Big girls don't cry (they don't cry)
  Big girls don't cry (who said they don't cry)
  
  Baby I was cruel (I was cruel)
  Baby I'm a fool (I'm such a fool)
  
  (Silly girl) Shame on you your Mama said
  (Silly girl) Shame on you, you cried in bed
  (Silly girl) Shame on you, you told a lie
  Big girls do cry
  
  Big girls don't cry (they don't cry)
  Big girls don't cry (that's just an alibi)
  
  repeat to fade Big girls don't cry
