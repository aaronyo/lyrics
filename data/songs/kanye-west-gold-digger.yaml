  [Jamie Foxx]
  She take my money when I'm in need
  Yea she's a trifflin friend indeed
  Oh she's a gold digga way over town
  That dig's on me
  
  [Chorus:]
  (She takes my money)
  Now I aint sayin she a gold digger (When I'm Need)
  But she aint messin wit no broke niggaz
  (She takes my money)
  Now I aint sayin she a gold digger (When I'm need)
  but she aint messin wit no broke niggaz
  get down girl go ahead get down (On ur knees)
  get down girl go ahead get down (On ur knees)
  get down girl go ahead get down (On ur knees)
  get down girl go ahead
  
  [Verse 1:]
  Cutie the bomb
  Met her at a beauty salon
  With a baby louis vuitton
  Under her underarm
  She said I can tell you ROC
  I can tell by ya charm
  Far as girls you got a flock
  I can tell by ya charm and ya arm
  but I'm lookin for the one
  have you seen her
  My psychic told me she have a ass like Serena
  Trina, Jennifer Lopez, four kids
  An i gotta take all they bad ass to show-biz
  Ok get ya kids but then they got their friends
  I Pulled up in the Benz, they all got up In
  We all went to Den and then I had to pay
  If you fuckin with this girl then you betta be payed
  You know why
  It take too much to touch her
  From what I heard she got a baby by Busta
  My best friend say she use to fuck wit Usher
  I dont care what none of yall say I still love her
  
  [Chorus:]
  (She takes my money)
  Now I aint sayin she a gold digger (When I'm Need)
  But she aint messin wit no broke niggaz
  (She takes my money)
  Now I aint sayin she a gold digger (When I'm need)
  but she aint messin wit no broke niggaz
  get down girl go ahead get down (On ur knees)
  get down girl go ahead get down (On ur knees)
  get down girl go ahead get down (On ur knees)
  get down girl go ahead
  
  [Verse 2:]
  18 years, 18 years
  She got one of yo kids got you for 18 years
  I know somebody payin child support for one of his kids
  His baby momma's car and crib is bigger than his
  You will see him on TV Any Given Sunday
  Win the Superbowl and drive off in a Hyundai
  She was spose to buy ya shorty TYCO with ya money
  She went to the doctor got lypo with ya money
  She walkin around lookin like Michael with ya money
  Should of got that insured got GEICO for ya moneeey
  If you aint no punk holla We Want Prenup
  WE WANT PRENUP!, Yeaah
  It's something that you need to have
  Cause when she leave yo ass she gone leave with half
  18 years, 18 years
  And on her 18th birthday he found out it wasn't his
  
  [Chorus:]
  (She takes my money)
  Now I aint sayin she a gold digger (When I'm Need)
  But she aint messin wit no broke niggaz
  (She takes my money)
  Now I aint sayin she a gold digger (When I'm need)
  but she aint messin wit no broke niggaz
  get down girl go ahead get down (On ur knees)
  get down girl go ahead get down (On ur knees)
  get down girl go ahead get down (On ur knees)
  get down girl go ahead
  
  [Verse 3:]
  Now I aint sayin you a gold digger you got needs
  You dont want ya dude to smoke but he can't buy weed
  You got out to eat and he cant pay yall cant leave
  There's dishes in the back, he gotta roll up his sleeves
  But why yall washin watch him
  He gone make it into a Benz out of that Datson
  He got that ambition baby look in his eyes
  This week he moppin floorz next week it's the fries
  So, stick by his side
  I know his dude's ballin but yea thats nice
  And they gone keep callin and tryin
  But you stay right girl
  But when you get on he leave yo ass for a white girl
  
  Get down girl go ahead get down
  Get down girl go ahead get down
  get down girl go ahead get down
  get down girl go ahead
