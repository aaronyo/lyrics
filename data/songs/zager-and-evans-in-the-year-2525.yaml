  In the year 2525
  If man is still alive
  If woman can survive
  They may find
  
  In the year 3535
  Ain't gonna need to tell the truth, tell no lie
  Everything you think, do and say
  Is in the pill you took today
  
  In the year 4545
  You ain't gonna need your teeth, won't need your eyes
  You won't find a thing to chew
  Nobody's gonna look at you
  
  In the year 5555
  Your arms hangin' limp at your sides
  Your legs got nothin' to do
  Some machine's doin' that for you
  
  In the year 6565
  You won't need no husband, won't need no wife
  You'll pick your son, pick your daughter too
  From the bottom of a long glass tube
  
  In the year 7510
  If God's a-coming, He oughta make it by then
  Maybe He'll look around Himself and say
  "Guess it's time for the judgement day"
  
  In the year 8510
  God is gonna shake His mighty head
  He'll either say "I'm pleased where man has been"
  Or tear it down, and start again
  
  In the year 9595
  I'm kinda wonderin' if man is gonna be alive
  He's taken everything this old earth can give
  And he ain't put back nothing
  
  Now it's been ten thousand years
  Man has cried a billion tears
  For what, he never knew
  Now man's reign is through
  
  But through eternal night
  The twinkling of starlight
  So very far away
