  [50 Cent]
  Go, go, go, go, go, go
  Go, shorty
  It's your birthday
  We gon' party like it's your birthday
  We gon' sip Bacardi like it's your birthday
  And you know we don't give a fuck
  cause it's not your birthday!
  
  [Chorus (2x)]
  You can find me in the club, bottle full of bub
  Look mami i got the X ,if you into takin drugs
  Im into havin sex i aint into makin love
  So come give me a hug if you into getting rubbed
  
  [Verse]
  When I pull out up front, you see the Benz on dubs
  When I roll 20 deep, it's 20 knives in the club
  Niggas heard I fuck with Dre, now they wanna show me love
  When you sell like Eminem, and the hoes they wanna fuck 
  But homie ain't nothing change hoes down, G's up
  I see Xzibit in the Cut that nigga roll that weed up
  If you watch how I move you'll mistake me for a playa or pimp
  Been hit wit a few shells but I dont walk wit a limp(Im ight)
  In the hood, In L.A, they saying "50 you hot"
  They like me, I want them to love me like they love 'Pac
  But holla in New York them niggas'll tell ya im loco
  And the plan is to put the rap game in a choke hold
  I'm full of focused man, my money on my mind
  I got a mill out the deal and I'm still on the grind
  Now shorty said she feeling my style, she feeling my flow
  Her girlfriend wanna get bi and they ready to go
  
  [Chorus (2x)]
  
  [Bridge]
  My flow, my show brought me the doe
  That bought me all my fancy things 
  My crib, my cars, my clothes, my jewels
  Look nigga i done came up and i ain't change.
  
  [Verse]
  And you should love it, way more then you hate it
  Nigga you mad? I thought that you'd be happy I made it
  I'm that cat by the bar toasting to the good life
  You that faggot ass nigga trying to pull me back right?
  When my jaws get to bumpin in the club it's on
  I wink my eye at you bitch, if she smiles she gone
  If the roof on fire, let the motherfucker burn
  If you talking bout money homie, I ain't concerned
  I'm a tell you what Banks told me cause go 'head switch the style up
  If the niggas hate then let 'em hate 
  and watch the money pile up
  Or we go upside they head wit a bottle of bub
  They know where we fuckin' be
  
  [Chorus (2x)]
  
  [Talking]
  [Laughing] Don't try to act like you ain't know where we been either nigga, but i lo chupe a junior yeah
  In the club all the time nigga, its about to pop off nigga
