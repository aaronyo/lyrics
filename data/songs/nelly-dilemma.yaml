  Check it, check it, check it, uhh
  I met this chick and she just moved right up the block from me
  And uhh, she got the hots for me the finest thing my hood done seen
  But oh no, oh no, she gotta a man
  and a son, doh'ohhh, but that's okay
  Cause I, wait for my cue and just listen, play my position
  Like a shortstop, pick up e'rything mami hittin
  And in no time.. (no time) I..
  I plan to make this one here mi-i-ne.. and that's for sure
  Cause I, I never been the type to, break up a happy home
  But uh, there's somethin bout baby girl I just can't leave alone
  So tell me ma what's it gonna be?  She said
  (You don't know what you mean to me)  C'mon!
  
  [Chorus]
  
  [Nelly]
  Check it, check it, check it, uhh
  I see a lot and you look and I never say a word
  I know how niggaz start actin trippin out herre about they girls
  And there's no way-ayy-hey, Nelly gon' fight over
  (I ain't fightin over NO dame) no day-hey-ame.. as you can see
  But I, I like your steez, your style, your whole demeanor
  The way you come through and holla and swoop me in his 2-seater
  Now that's gangstah-ah-ahhh..
  And I got special ways to thank yah-ah-ahh.... don't you forget it
  But uh, it ain't that easy for you to pack and leave him
  But uh, you and dirty got times for different reasons
  I respect that and right before I turn to leave, she said.. she said..
  (You don't know what you mean to me) she said.. she said, c'mon!
  
  [Chorus]
