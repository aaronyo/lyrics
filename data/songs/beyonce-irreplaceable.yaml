  to the left 
  to the left 
  
  to the left to the left 
  everything you own in the box to the left 
  in the closet, yes thats my stuff 
  yes, if I bought it, then please don't touch (don't touch) 
  
  and keep on talking that mess, thats fine 
  could you walk and talk, at the same time? 
  and- its my name thats on that bag 
  so go move your bags, let me call you a cab 
  standing in the front yard, telling me 
  how I'm such a fool, talking 'bout 
  how I'll never ever find a man like you 
  
  you got me twisted 
  
  you must not know 'bout me 
  you must not know 'bout me 
  I could have another you in a minute 
  matter fact, he'll be here in a minute (baby) 
  
  you must not know 'bout me 
  you must not know 'bout me 
  I'll have another you by tomorrow 
  so don't you ever for a second get to thinkin' 
  you're irreplaceable 
  
  so go ahead and get grown 
  call up that chick, and see if shes home 
  oops I bet you thought, that I didn't know 
  what did you think 
  I was putting you out for? 
  because you was untrue 
  rolling around in the car that I bought you 
  baby, drop them keys 
  hurry up, before your taxi leaves 
  
  standing in the front yard, telling me 
  how I'm such a fool, talking 'bout 
  how I'll never ever find a man like you 
  
  you got me twisted 
  
  you must not know 'bout me 
  you must not know 'bout me 
  I could have another you in a minute 
  matter fact, he'll be here in a minute (baby) 
  
  you must not know 'bout me 
  you must not know 'bout me 
  I'll have another you by tomorrow 
  so don't you ever for a second get to thinkin' 
  you're irreplaceable 
  
  so since I'm not your everything 
  how about I be nothing? nothing at all to you 
  baby i won't shed a tear for you 
  I won't lose a wink of sleep 
  cause the truth of the matter is 
  replacing you is so easy 
  
  to the left to the left 
  to the left to the left 
  
  mmmmmmmm 
  to the left to the left 
  everything you own in the box to left 
  
  to the left to the left 
  don't you ever for a second get to thinking 
  you're irreplaceable 
  
  you must not know 'bout me 
  you must not know 'bout me 
  I could have another you in a minute 
  matter fact, he'll be here in a minute (baby) 
  
  you must not know 'bout me 
  you must not know 'bout me 
  I'll have another you by tomorrow 
  so don't you ever for a second get to thinkin' 
  
  you must not know 'bout me 
  you must not know 'bout me 
  I could have another you in a minute 
  matter fact, he'll be here in a minute (baby) 
  
  you can pack all your things- we're finished 
  cause you made your bed now lay in it 
  I could have another you by tomorrow 
  don't you ever for a second get to thinkin' 
  you're irreplaceable
