  [Verse 1:]
  
  Baby I just don't get it 
  Do you enjoy being hurt? 
  I know you smelled the perfume, the make-up on his shirt
  You don't believe his stories
  You know that they're all lies
  Bad as you are, you stick around and I just don't know why
  
  If I was ya man (baby you)
  Never worry bout (what I do)
  I'd be coming home (back to you)
  Every night, doin' you right 
  You're the type of woman (deserves good thangs)
  Fistful of diamonds (hand full of rings)
  Baby you're a star (I just want to show you, you are) 
  
  [Chorus:]
  
  You should let me love you 
  Let me be the one to give you everything you want and need
  Baby good love and protection 
  Make me your selection 
  Show you the way love's supposed to be 
  Baby you should let me love you, love you, love you 
  
  [Verse 2:]
  
  Listen
  Your true beauty's description looks so good that it hurts 
  You're a dime plus ninety-nine and it's a shame 
  Don't even know what you're worth 
  Everywhere you go they stop and stare 
  Cause you're bad and it shows 
  From your head to your toes, Out of control, baby you know 
  
  If I was ya man (baby you)
  Never worry bout (what I do)
  I'd be coming home (back to you)
  Every night doin' you right 
  You're the type of woman (deserves good thangs)
  Fistful of diamonds (hand full of rings)
  Baby you're a star (I just want to show you, you are) 
  
  [Chorus:]
  
  You should let me love you 
  Let me be the one to give you everything you want and need
  Ooh Baby good love and protection 
  Make me your selection 
  Show you the way love's supposed to be 
  Baby you should let me.... 
  
  [Bridge:]
  
  You deserve better girl (you know you deserve better) 
  We should be together girl (baby)
  With me and you it's whatever girl, hey!
  So can we make this thing ours?
  
  [Chorus:]
  
  You should let me love you 
  Let me be the one to give you everything you want and need
  Baby good love and protection 
  Make me your selection 
  Show you the way love's supposed to be 
  Baby you should let me love you, love you, love you 
  
  [repeat til it ends (about 3 times)]
  
  [Mario (talking):]
  Let me love you that's all you need baby
