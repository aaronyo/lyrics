  See my days are cold without you 
  But I'm hurtin while im with you 
  And though my heart can't take no more 
  I keep on running back to you 
  See my days are cold without you 
  But I'm hurtin while im with you 
  And though my heart can't take no more 
  I keep on running back to you 
  
  Baby I don't know why ya treatin me so bad 
  You said you love me, no one above me 
  And I was all you had 
  And though my heart is eating for ya
  I can't stop crying 
  I don't know how
  I allow you to treat me this way and still i stay 
  
  See my days are cold without you
  But I'm hurtin while im with you 
  And though my heart can't take no more 
  I keep on running back to you 
  See my days are cold without you 
  But I'm hurtin while im with you 
  And though my heart can't take no more 
  I keep on running back to you 
  
  Baby I don't know why ya wanna do me wrong
  See when I'm home, I'm all alone 
  And you are always gone 
  And boy, you kno I really love you 
  I can't deny 
  I can't see how you could bring me to so many tears 
  after all these years 
  
  See my days are cold without you 
  But I'm hurtin while im with you 
  And though my heart can't take no more 
  I keep on running back to you 
  See my days are cold without you 
  But I'm hurtin while im with you 
  And though my heart can't take no more 
  I keep on running back to you 
  
  Oohhhhh
  I trusted you, I trusted you
  So sad, so sad 
  What love will make you do 
  All the things that we accept 
  Be the things that we regret 
  To all of my ladies (ladies) feel me 
  C'mon sing wit me 
  See, when I get the strength to leave, you 
  Always tell me that you need, me
  And I'm weak cause I believe, you
  And I'm mad because I love, you
  So I stop and think that may-be
  You can learn to appreciate, me
  Then it all remains the same that
  You ain't never gonna change 
  (never gonna change, never gonna change)
  
  See my days are cold without you
  But I'm hurtin while im with you 
  And though my heart can't take no more 
  I keep on running back to you 
  See my days are cold without you 
  But I'm hurtin while im with you 
  And though my heart can't take no more
  I keep on running back to you 
  
  Baby why you hurt me leave me and desert me 
  Boy I gave you all my heart
  And all you did was tear it up
  Looking out my window
  Knowing that I should go 
  Even when I pack my bags
  This something always hold me back
