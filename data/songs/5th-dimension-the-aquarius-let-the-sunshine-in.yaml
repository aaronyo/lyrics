  (Words by James Rado and Gerome Ragni: Music by Galt MacDermot)
  When the moon is in the Seventh House
  And Jupiter aligns with Mars
  Then peace will guide the planets
  And love will steer the stars
  This is the dawning of the age of Aquarius
  Age of Aquarius
  Aquarius!
  Aquarius!
  
  Harmony and understanding
  Sympathy and trust abounding
  No more falsehoods or derisions
  Golden living dreams of visions
  Mystic crystal revelation
  And the mind's true liberation
  Aquarius!
  Aquarius!
  
  When the moon is in the Seventh House
  And Jupiter aligns with Mars
  Then peace will guide the planets
  And love will steer the stars
  This is the dawning of the age of Aquarius
  Age of Aquarius
  Aquarius!
  Aquarius!
  Aquarius!
  Aquarius!
  
  [Instrumental and tempo shift]
  
  Let the sunshine, let the sunshine in, the sunshine in
  Let the sunshine, let the sunshine in, the sunshine in
  Let the sunshine, let the sunshine in, the sunshine in
  
  [Continue to end with concurrent scat]
  
  Oh, let it shine, c'mon
  Now everybody just sing along
  Let the sun shine in
  Open up your heart and let it shine on in
  When you are lonely, let it shine on
  Got to open up your heart and let it shine on in
  And when you feel like you've been mistreated
  And your friends turn away
  Just open your heart, and shine it on in
  
  [Fade]
