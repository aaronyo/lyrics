  I gotta feeling...
  That tonight's gonna be a good night
  That tonight's gonna be a good night
  That tonight's gonna be a good, good night
  
  A feeling... Woohoo
  That tonight's gonna be a good night
  That tonight's gonna be a good night
  That tonight's gonna be a good, good night
  
  Tonight's the night,
  Let's live it up
  I got my money,
  Let's spend it up
  Go out and smash it
  Like oh my God
  Jump off that sofa,
  Let's get, get off
  
  I know that we'll have a ball
  If we get down and go out and just lose it all
  I feel stressed out, I wanna let it go
  Let's go way out spaced out
  And losing all control
  (Chi CHi Chi)
  
  Fill up my cup,
  mazel tov
  Look at her dancing,
  Just take it off
  Let's paint the town,
  We'll shut it down
  Let's burn the roof,
  And then we'll do it again
  
  Let's do it,
  Let's do it,
  Let's do it,
  Let's do it
  And do it and do it,
  Let's live it up
  And do it and do it
  And do it, do it, do it
  Let's do it, let's do it,
  Let's do it
  
  'Cause I gotta feeling, woohoo,
  That tonight's gonna be a good night
  That tonight's gonna be a good night
  That tonight's gonna be a good, good night
  
  A feeling, woohoo,
  That tonight's gonna be a good night
  That tonight's gonna be a good night
  That tonight's gonna be a good, good night
  
  I gotta a feeling
  Tonight's the night
  (Hey! )
  Let's live it up
  (Let's live it up)
  I got my money
  (Paid! )
  Let's spend it up
  (Let's spend it up)
  
  Go out and smash it
  (Smash it)
  Like oh my God
  (Like oh my God)
  Jump off that sofa
  (Come on! )
  Let's get, get off
  
  Fill up my cup
  (Drank)
  Mazel tov
  (L'chaim)
  Look at her dancing
  (Move it, move it)
  Just take it off
  
  Let's paint the town
  (Paint the town)
  We'll shut it down
  (Let's shut it down)
  Let's burn the roof
  (Whoooo)
  And then we'll do it again
  
  Let's do it,
  Let's do it,
  Let's do it,
  Let's do it
  And do it and do it,
  Let's live it up
  And do it and
  Do it and do it,
  Do it, do it
  Let's do it, let's do it,
  Let's do it, do it, do it, do it
  
  Here we come,
  Here we go,
  We gotta rock
  (Rock rock rock rock rock)
  Easy come,
  Easy go,
  Now we on top
  (Top top top top top)
  Feel the shot,
  Body rock,
  Rock it,
  Don't stop
  (Stop stop stop stop stop)
  Round and round, up and down,
  Around the clock
  (Rock rock rock rock rock)

  Wednesday and Thursday
  Friday, Saturday,
  Saturday to Sunday
  Get, get, get, get,
  Get with us, you know what we say, say
  Party every day, p-p-p-party every day
  
  And I'm feelin', woohoo,
  That tonight's gonna be a good night
  That tonight's gonna be a good night
  That tonight's gonna be a good, good night
  
  I gotta feeling, woohoo,
  That tonight's gonna be a good night
  That tonight's gonna be a good night
  That tonight's gonna be a good, good night
  
  Woohoo
