title: I'm A Believer
lyrics: |
  (Neil Diamond)
  I thought love was only true in fairy tales
  Meant for someone else but not for me.
  Love was out to get me
  That's the way it seemed.
  Disappointment haunted all my dreams.
  
  Then I saw her face, now I'm a believer
  Not a trace of doubt in my mind.
  I'm in love, I'm a believer!
  I couldn't leave her if I tried.
  
  I thought love was more or less a given thing,
  Seems the more I gave the less I got.
  What's the use in tryin'?
  All you get is pain.
  When I needed sunshine I got rain.
  
  Then I saw her face, now I'm a believer
  Not a trace of doubt in my mind.
  I'm in love, I'm a believer!
  I couldn't leave her if I tried.
