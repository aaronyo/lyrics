title: People Got To Be Free
lyrics: |
  (Words by Felix Cavaliere and Music by Edward Brigati, Jr.)
  All the world over, so easy to see
  People everywhere just wanna be free
  Listen, please listen, that's the way it should be
  Deep in the valley, people got to be free
  
  You should see what a lovely, lovely world this'd be
  Everyone learned to live together, ah-hah-unh
  Seems to me such an itty bitty thing should be
  Why can't you and me learn to love one another?
  
  All the world over, so easy to see
  People everywhere just wanna be free
  I can't understand it, so simple to me
  People everywhere just got to be free
  
  If there's a man who is down and needs a helpin' hand
  All it takes is you to understand and to pull him through, ah-hah-unh
  Seems to me we got to solve it individually, ah-hah-unh
  And I'll do unto you what you do to me
  
  Shout it from the mountain on out to the sea (out to the sea)
  No two ways about it, people have to be free
  Ask me my opinion, my opinion will be
  Nat'ral situation for a man to be free
  
  Git right on board now
  
  [Instrumental Interlude]
  
  Oh, what a feelin's just come over me
  Love can move a mountain, make a blind man see
  Everybody sing it now come on let's go see
  Deep in the valley now, we ought to be free
  
  [Spoken:]
  See that train over there?
  That's the train of freedom
  It's about to 'rrive any minute, now
  You know it's been'a long, long overdue
  Look out 'cause it's a'comin' right on through
