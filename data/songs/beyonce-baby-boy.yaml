  Baby boy not a day goes by
  Without my fantasies

  Picture us dancin real close 
  In a dark, dark corner of a basement party(who naa naa)
  Everytime I close my eyes 
  It's like everyone's left but you and me
  (whoa naa naa)
  In our own little world 
  The music is the sun
  The dancefloor becomes the sea(who naa naa)
  Feels, like, true paradise to me 
  
  Baby boy you stay on my mind(whoa naa naa)
  Fulfill my fantasy 
  I think about you all the time
  I see you in my dreams 
  Baby boy not a day goes by
  Without my fantasies
  I think about you all the time
  I see you in my dreams
