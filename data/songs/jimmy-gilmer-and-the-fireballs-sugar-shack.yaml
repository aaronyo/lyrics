  There's a crazy little shack beyond the tracks
  And ev'rybody calls it the sugar shack
  Well, it's just a coffeehouse and it's made out of wood
  Expresso coffee tastes mighty good
  That's not the reason why I've got to get back
  To that sugar shack, whoa baby
  To that sugar shack.
  
  There's this cute little girlie, she's a'workin' there
  A black leotard and her feet are bare
  I'm gonna drink a lotta coffee, spend a little cash
  Make that girl love me when I put on some trash
  You can understand why I've got to get back
  To that sugar shack, whoa baby
  To that sugar shack, yeah honey
  To that sugar shack, whoa yes
  To that sugar shack.
  
  Now that sugar shack queen is a'married to me, yeah yeah
  We just sit around and dream of those old memories
  Ah, but one of these days I'm gonna lay down tracks
  In the direction of that sugar shack
  Just me and her yes we're gonna go back
  To that sugar shack,
  Whoa uh ohT
  o that sugar shack, yeah honey
  To our sugar shack
  
  [Fade]
  
  Yeh, yeh, yeh, our sugar shack
