  (Don and Phil Everly)
  Don't want your love any more
  Don't want your kisses that's for sure
  I die each time I hear the sound
  Here he comes, that's Cathy's clown
  
  I gotta stand tall
  You know a man can't crawl
  For when he knows he's telling lies
  And he lets them pass on by
  He's not a man at all
  
  Don't want your love any more
  Don't want your kisses that's for sure
  I die each time I hear the sound
  Here he comes, that's Cathy's clown
  
  When you see me shed a tear
  And when you know that it's sincere
  Don't you think it's kind of sad
  That you're treating me so bad
  Or don't you even care
  
  Don't want your love any more
  Don't want your kisses that's for sure
  I die each time I hear the sound
  Here he comes, that's Cathy's clown
